                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>On the website reached via the address "iamadatapoint.com" (hereafter the 'Site'), we offer a sign-up service for a ticketed theater performance and art exhibition, Quantified Self. This project is a part of Michael Skirpan's (mwskirpan.com) PhD work at University of Colorado at Boulder, and is supported by Tom Yeh's Sikuli Lab and CU-Boulder's Engineering Excellence Fund.</p>
                <p>The show uses attendeesâ€™ own data to generate the art and dictate the experience. Thus, to participate in the experience, users are asked to connect through one or more of their email and social media accounts, in keeping with this Policy (hereafter the 'Policy'). Users also have the choice to not share information or tell us they do not use certain online services. The only consequence of not sharing is for free performances, when tickets are limited, we may prefer users who share more since it will improve the quality of the show.</p>
                <p>These terms may be modified at any time by University of Colorado without notification to the users. It is advisable to reread the terms at the time of signing up.</p>
                <h2>ARTICLE 1. TERMS FOR AGREEING TO SHARE DATA IN ADVANCE OF THE SHOW</h2>
                <p>To make it possible to personalize the performance and exhibit that are offered the night of the user's attendance, after deciding to book a ticket, the user is asked to share their name and surname, and then to share access to their data held by third-party services. We DO NOT store the entirety of the user's shared dataset, but rather build a profile associated with the user similar to a cookie tracking service, and only store select data relevant to specific exhibits for the night you attend. This is done by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authorizing through the user's Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Spotify, and/or Tumblr account(s).</li>
                    <li>Taking a short survey on our website</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By authorizing one or more of your accounts to the Site, you give consent for Quantified Self's team to access the data on such accounts which may include friends' names, photos, life events, etc.</p>

                <h2>ARTICLE 2. LIABILITY</h2>
                <p>It is expressly understood that Quantified Self's staff and parent organizations will in no way be held responsible for any damages suffered by users and/or any third party as a result of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unavailability or malfunction of the Site, regardless of the cause</li>
                    <li>Loss of data specific to the user</li>
                    <li>Consequence of any computer virus</li>
                    <li>Any unforeseeable circumstance that prevents Quantified Self from fulfilling this contract such as users signing up through an insecure or compromised connection.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Due to the characteristics of the Internet, particularly the fact that the staff and sponsors of Quantified Self cannot ensure every user is using proper security precautions, Quantified Self's staff and sponsors will in no event be held liable for damages of any kind, whether accidental or suffered by the user or third parties, and whether caused or not by third parties.</p>

                    <li>Upon requesting a ticket, and sharing your data, until the end of the performance on the night you attend, you have the right to request the deletion of all personal data we have obtained. In the event you share your data and do not attend the event, we will delete all of your personal data following the performance.</li>
                    <li>Your data will never be subject to any commercial, promotional, or third-party use of any kind. We will never share your data unless we are required to by law.</li>
