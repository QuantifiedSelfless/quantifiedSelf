                <p class="py1 news-stub">Set 40 years in the future, guests enter the home of Amelia Bloom, a star employee at DesignCraft - the world leader in at-home technology. Amelia has developed deep suspicions of what her company is up to and what exactly they intend to do with all this data they've collected. In the midst of a desparate attempt to rupture the power of a tech giant, audience members are brought into the center of the drama to have the chance to experience the future first hand. Everyone who enters will be able to freely explore, play, and hopefully question what's at stake with all this data we're collecting.</p>
                <p class="py1">We are an immersive theatre and interactive art project currently working in University of Colorado in the Department of Computer Science in collaboration with the CU Boulder Department of Theatre and Dance and the ATLAS Institute. Our project received support from the <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/semi-finalists/quantified-self-data-experience-understanding-your-data-and-the-world-it-creates/">John S. and James L. Knight Foundationâ€™s Knight News Challenge</a> and <a href="http://eef.colorado.edu">CU-Boulder's Engineering Excellence Fund</a>. Our first production is presented by ATLAS CMAP, an incubator for the novel and experimental use of technology in music, dance, visual art, theater, film, and hybrid and diverse new media.</p>
                <p class="py1">Our project's goal is to engage a broad audience of people who are interested in the future and ethics of data sharing online. More than discussing privacy, we aim to show people the possibilities around product development, research, artificial intelligence, and human inference given the amounts of data owned by third-parties. To achieve this, we ask people to share their data with us for the duration of the show so that we can meet guests at the level of their actual lives, only to then take them somewhere else to expand their imagination.</p>
                <p class="py1">Our first show will happen April 28 - May 1, 2016 in Boulder, CO at ATLAS's Black Box Theater. We intend to move the show into other locations and run public events that open public dialogue around the ethical considerations we have placed in the performance. If you are interested in seeing this production come to your location or to collaborate on a run of it, please contact our project lead at: michael[dot]skirpan[at]colorado[dot]edu</p>

        <div class="clearfix">
            <div class="col-8 mx-auto white">
                <h3>How is my data used, specifically my gmail data?</h3>
                <p>Once you authenticate with an account, an automated service goes through data that is relevant to a particular exhibit within our production. All of your data is encrypted and left, unable to be seen, until the night of the show when we put a private key on a bracelet upon checking in. We will have a human look at small pieces of data the night of the show needed to do personalization of certain small parts; however, this data will come from your public accounts.</p>
                <p>Your GMail data will never be looked at by another human and will remain encrypted, stored, and only shown in the event you consent to using an exhibit with your bracelet.</p>
                <h3>Why trust your group with my data?</h3>
                <p>Because our interest is purely in educating and entertaining you. We derive no personal gain or monetary value from your data. We never sell or share any of your data (unlike your providers who own your data). Our privacy policy is actually MORE STRICT and MORE SECURE than other online providers. All of the data you share with us gets immediately encrypted such that even our team cannot see your data. The only way for your data to be unencrypted is for multiple of the production staff to come together in the same room and provide multiple private keys (which we do each night of the show). Then, following the night of your visit, we permanently delete everything you shared.</p>
                <h3>Are you going to try and intentionally embarrass or harrass me when I come to the show?</h3>
                <p>No. Interacting with your data is entirely up to you during the show. We will not use your data to make fun of or harm you. However, we do have some surprises in the show that may involve you. This is immersive theatre so you should anticipate the possibility of having yourself addressed in the show. Also, since the interactions are both private and public forms, if you choose to interact with an exhibit, we cannot guarantee you won't feel nervous or uncomfortable. But our exhibits are not designed to harm or slander you. Do remember this is meant to be an impactful experience so while we do take serious measures to not violate your privacy or put you in negative situations. The point of coming is to take the small risk of experiencing your online data in an artistic, thought-provoking format.</p>
                <h3>Why are you doing all of this?</h3>
                <p>We want to open up more conversation and improve people's understanding of how personal data is being used to develop new products, advertise, perform research, and do surveillance. It's our view that most users do not know what their data is used for nor what it is capable of. We also see technologists interested in thinking through their decisions and having more insight into how users feel about what they are doing. So we want to close the gap between technologists and users to improve dialogue around ethics and possible futures to help move toward a more moral and transparent society.</p>
                <p>We also simply want to show you something beautiful and enjoyable. Our hope is to run this show in many cities and reach many people so that more individuals can make better choices online and have an informed voice in discussions about our shared future.</p>
                <h3>Is it normal to feel weird about all this?</h3>
                <p>Oh yeah. That's why we're doing this -- because the world is super weird so we should probably talk about it.</p>
